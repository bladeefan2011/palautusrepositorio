Start, stop, continue, more of, less of wheel is a way to communicate with your team which attributes should continue to be used in the future and which ones the team should stop. The point is to draw a circle, divide it in to 5 parts and name them start, stop, continue, more of, less of. All members of the team can then decide which things should continue and which ones shouldn't. The format encourages openness and communication. Glad, sad and mad is a way for a team to rank which things they are happy about the sprint they just concluded and which subjects make them annoyed and sad. The members vote which of the subjects should be discussed in greater detail. These topics are then discussed better. Usually the most important issues are then discussed first, and if the team has enough time the lesser ones will also be discussed.
